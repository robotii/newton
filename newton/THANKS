The stylesheets used in Newton are strongly based on the stylesheets used
in the Dokuwiki project located at

        http://wiki.splitbrain.org/wiki:dokuwiki

The syntax used in Newton is a mix of the Dokuwiki syntax and other wikis 
I've used in the past. I chose the syntax mix that I felt most comfortable 
with.
